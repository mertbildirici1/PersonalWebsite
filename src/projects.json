    "description": "This project demonstrates the A* pathfinding algorithm, a widely used pathfinding algorithm in computer science. The app visualizes the algorithm's operation by animating the process of finding the shortest path between two points on a grid. Users can interact with the grid by changing the start and end points to observe the algorithm's behavior in real time."
